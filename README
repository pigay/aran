General Information
===================

LibAran is a 2D/3D Fast Multipole Method software library. Distributed under
the GNU LGPL, it provides a C API to allow developers to use such algorithms
in their own applications.


Currently supported features include:

 - 2D FMM algorithms through Laurent Series.
 - 3D FMM algorithms through complex spherical harmonics series. These series
   can handle Newton/Coulomb potentials. Sparse translation operators (O(p^3)
   complexity) are included.
 - Dynamic QTree/OcTree LibVsg (http://www.libvsg.org) VsgPRTree2d and
   VsgPRTree3d) particles filtering.
